# Android Basics Nanodegree

This book summarizes the key concepts, projects and learning outcomes from the **Android Basics Nanodegree** at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) by Google.

## **Timeline**

I started the course on January 11th and completed it on 17th April. According to some forums and reviews the course lasts 165 hours.

## **Projects**

The  projects of the course were the following:

* Business card app.
* Score Keeper
* Quiz App
* Musical Structure
* Report Card class.
* Tour Guide app.
* Book Listing app.
* News app.
* Habit Tracker
* Inventory app. 

The projects can be found in [Github](https://github.com/CarlosAguA)

## **Time Tracking**

An app called **Toggle** was used in order to track the time I spent on each project. The time tracking was relevant from the 5th project to the last one, since they were the ones that required a  meaningful amount of time. The time tracking allowed me to keep  working regularly at a pace of 10-15 hrs p/week.
