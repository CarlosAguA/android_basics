# Data storage

---

This section of the ABND focuses on data storage.

According to the [android developers data storage documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html "Android developers data storage"), the options to save persistent application data are:

1. **Shared Preferences**.  Store private primitive data in key-value pairs.
2. **Internal Storage**. Store private data on the device memory.
3. **External Storage**.  Store public data on the shared external storage.
4. **SQLite Databases**. Store structured data in a private database.
5. **Network Connection**. Store data on the web with your own network server.

So the main focus of this lesson relays on option 4 which is **SQLite Databases**.

A rich visual explanation takes place on the video **8. Quiz:Different data storage** on the Lesson 1 of the  ABND course.

In order to understand how does this option works, this chapter walks you through the  sqlite commands, and creating a database first on the computer and then on the android device through emulator.
