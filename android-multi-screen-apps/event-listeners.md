# Event listeners

---

The user interact with the apps by touching the screen. This corresponds to user input events. You can choose to get notified when certain events occur on a specific view. 

The paradigm is called : **listening for a certain event**. Once you know the event has happened, you can program what should happen when an user interacts with a part of the UI.
