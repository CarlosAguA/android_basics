# Intents

## What types of intents exist?

There are two types of intents. Explicit and implicit.

## What is an intent?

An intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component.

## What is an app component?

They are the essential builiding blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.

There are four different types of app components:

* Activities.
* Services.
* Broadcast receivers.
* Content providers.

## What is an explicit intent?

An explicit intent allows you to **start a component** in your own app, because you know the class name of **the activity or service **you want to start.

## What is an implicit intent?

An implicit intent allows you to **start an activity** in another app by **describing a simple action** you would like to perform in an intent object. It does not name a specific component.This is specific for an **implicit** intent. Some examples are:

* Open a website in your app.
* Create alarm
* Capture a picture and return it.
* Make a call.
