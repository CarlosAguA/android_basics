# Object Oriented Programming

## What are objects?

Objects are instances from a class.  An object will contain the state information depending on the class which was instantiated from. For that reason, an object holds specific information about the class. 

For example, the floor plan of a house would be the class and the house would be the instance.

## What is a java class?

A java class is the definition of how an object behaves and the possible states it could have.

## What is a constructor?

A constructor is defined within the class and is used to create object instances. It can or not receive parameters and multiple constructors within a class are allowed.
