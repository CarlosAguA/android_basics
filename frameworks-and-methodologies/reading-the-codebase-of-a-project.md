# Reading a codebase

When you import a project you can start exploring it

1. Check the java folder \(where the logic of the app is\)
2. Check the resource folder \(where everything related to the appearance of the app is\).Resources can include xml files, images and other media files.
3. Open the layout folder and explore it. 
4. Open the mipmap folder which contains the icon of the app.
5. Images of the app go on the drawable folder.
6. The values folder contains: dimensions.colors, strings ,styles: the theme of the app is defined here.
